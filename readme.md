hello and welcome to my first app! 

 #How to use
 
1) you need to make sure that the developer option on your phone is working, and installing apps with USB is allowed.

2) run those commands in your terminal: 
```
 npm install 
 react-native run-android
```

its not allways installing properly, so if this not working run the seconde command again.
